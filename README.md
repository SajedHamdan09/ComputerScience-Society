# ComputerScience-Society

This repository contains the code for the website of the Computer Science Society at Phoenincica University. The website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap(used for the responsive layout).

This project was contributed to the society by me, the Vice President of the Computer Science Society. My goal was to create a platform that would foster a sense of community among the members and promote the sharing of knowledge and ideas.


The website serves as a platform for the members of the Computer Science Society to showcase the latest events, activities, and announcements. It features a clean and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
